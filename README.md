# 3DNester-cpp

Packing of 3D models for powder bed 3D printing. Also called nesting or 3D nesting. 
This project uses a simulated annealing algorithm for approach of a solution to the irregular 3D bin-packing problem. It currently supports the packing of one 3D model to maximum potential quantity. Octrees are used for collision detection in a broad and narrow phase detection algorithm.

This project is currently under development and may be made public/private as necessary for collaboration or display.
